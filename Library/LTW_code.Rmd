## Replicate Figure 1 of Ligon, Thomas & Worrall (2002)

In this document, my goal is to replicate Figure 1 of Ligon, Thomas & Worrall (2002).
For this, I need to derive upper and lower bounds of intervals of the ratio of marginal utilities.
I derive them by considering 4 cases separately; autarky case, non-overlapping case, overlapping case, and first best case.

Before diving into the derivations, there are several facts that we know (p.221 in the paper):
